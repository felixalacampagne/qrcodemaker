# qrcodemaker
Generate QR code for clipboard content, EPC data etc

20-Sep-2022 added a crude GUI for the generation of a mobile payment QR code. As part of this the project was converted
to a Maven project. The maven project builds a 'runnable jar' for the AccountQRMakerGUI application. The simple application
to a display a QR code for the clipboard content is still present and can be built by running the ant task 'QRCodemaker.xml'
